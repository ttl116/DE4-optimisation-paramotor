A few things to note about the discrepancies between the report and the code:
- Originally x(3) in the code was air-fuel ratio, while x(4) was the engine speed. In table 2 of the report the x values were shown to be in this order, whereas in the rest of the report x(3) is the engine speed and x(4) is the air-fuel ratio. The code has since been changed to be consistent with the rest of the report.
- In the report torque was set to be 18. In fact, the code was run with torque set to 22 to get the results shown in section C.
